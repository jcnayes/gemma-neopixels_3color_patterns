# 3-Color patterns for Gemma + NeoPixel rings

Have you done the Digibling workshop from Makertjej? Here are some more light patterns I made up, jumping off from the workshop 1 and 1.2 code.

### Programming notes
- Different size NeoPixel ring? The code default is 16-pixels (fits around a GEMMA), but this is programmed as a variable.
- The color codes used are from Material Design (500 level).
